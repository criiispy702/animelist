				<h1 class="h1-anime">Dragon Ball Franchise</h1>
					<p>This anime, the first one that I've ever watched, is where is all started. Overall, great anime series and franchise, and many fans around the world will agree with me. As I have grown and refined my taste of Japanese entertainment, I find myself a little bored with the anime now. Is it overrated, I'd say yes, quite a bit, but it is by no means, a bad anime.</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">Naruto Franchise</h1>
					<p>Another amazing anime. I will only be writing about the first Naruto series and not Shippuden. This anime made me get into anime once again but more seriously. Naruto is such a dynamic and likeable character its no wonder why this anime is one of the most well known in the world. Although, I must say, that this anime sometimes seems rather slow when developing fight scenes or action scenes. We get it, there a lot of trees in forest, we don't need to see the character jumping off every single one to comprehend that. Not to mention some fights last <em>soo</em> many episodes  </p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">Deathnote</h1>
					<p>This anime introduced to another completey different genre of anime. What set this anime apart for me what the fact that the main character was not a good person. The main character did not highlight the best qualities that a human can posess. As a viewer, this may leave you torn, do you actively root for the main character even if he is a villian. Do you still hope that the main character gets their happen ending? This is what makes Deathnote such a good anime and why its one of my all time favorites</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">Your Lie in April</h1>
					<p>No doubt that this wonderful anime has amassed quite a following in recent years. However, upon searching for a new anime to watch, I stumbled upon <em>Your Lie in April</em> which was conviently on Netflix. This anime is on the shorter side with less that 50 episodes. I should say, that this genre of anime is not exactly my favorite. I'm not too big on the romance genre in general. Due to this fact, I would not be able to give an unbiased review and will not be reviewing further.</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">Tiger and Bunny</h1>
					<p>This is a fun and light anime. I was looking for another short anime to enjoy and came across this anime. The characters are likeable, but not lovable, and you find yourself interested in with its storyline, which is just a little predicatble, but still interesting. With a new season coming as of 6/10/2020, Im sure I'll find myself watching the new season when it comes out.</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">My Hero Academia</h1>
					<p>Another great anime that has a massive following from all around the world. I only watched the first season of My Hero and I very much so enjoyed it. This anime definetly follows a overused archetype for its characters. You can almost tell a characters personality and role in the show by being shown a short 10 second clip of their interactions with other characters in the show or maybe by studying the appearance of characters. Which is not that horrible of a things but characters are very easy to digest, maybe a little too easy. Although the charcters themselves are very likeable.</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">Tokyo Ghoul</h1>
					<p>This anime was a step in a differnt direction for me. For me at least, it was most like Deathnote. This anime is a little heacy. Not exactly targeted torwards young audiences like many other animes are. I believe this is what makes this anime so great. While this anime is not as "universal" for audiences of all ages, it still manages to be so loved and praised. This anime targeted an older and more mature audience and became one of the hottest animes today.</p>

			<div class="h1-p2">
				<h1 class="h1-anime">Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood</h1>
					<p>One of my favorite animes of all time. The characters are lovable and the plot is addicting. I watched 20-25 episodes in one day. I can honestly say, that is anime will actually make you laugh at times while not primarily being label as a comedy. The storyline is so unique and its amazing to see how brothers Edward and Alphonse finally get their happy ending.</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">YuYu Hakusho</h1>
					<p>Amazing older anime. I had my doubts at first. Will this anime hold up after 25+ years? will it still manage to appeal to the younger generation of anime watchers. One word; YES! This is such a fun anime. Yusuke Urameshi, Sprit Detectice is such a dynamic and intersting character. Another anime that will truly make you laugh and smile along with the characters</p>

				<h1 class="h1-anime">HunterXHunter</h1>
					<p>And finally, my favorite anime on this page: HunterXHunter. This anime lures you in with its curious and action packed adventures and before you know it, you've watched 20 episodes in one sitting. Gon is such a fun charcter to watch on screen paird along with his posse. Its amazing to see how the characters grown with eachother which is why HunterXHuner takes the cake as my favorite anime</p>
